# BassGen
A Gan Based Bassguitar Generator built using Tensorflow and Python.
THIS IS A SMALL FUN SIDE PROJECT AND IS IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM ABLE TO CREATE PRODUCTION READY BASS LINES
 
Also this project uses a SoundFont(.sf2) File to render bass lines using FluidSynth
Here is the Link to the file I used: https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/2077

I made this project as a bassist myself, feel free to improve upon this. 
Have Fun :)
